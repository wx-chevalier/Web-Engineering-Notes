### Getting Started with Shadcn Installation

Now that we've explored what Shadcn is and its capabilities as a powerful UI component library, let's dive into the practical aspects of getting started with Shadcn installation. This section will guide you through the process of setting up Shadcn in your project and using your first component.

#### 1. Installing Shadcn using npm or yarn

To begin your journey with Shadcn, you'll need to install it in your project. You can do this using either npm or yarn, depending on your preference. Here's how to install Shadcn:

Using npm:

```
npm install @shadcn/ui
```

Using yarn:

```
yarn add @shadcn/ui
```

Once the installation is complete, you're ready to start configuring Shadcn in your project.

#### 2. Configuring Shadcn in your project

After installing Shadcn, you'll need to configure it in your project. This involves setting up the necessary files and dependencies. Here's a step-by-step guide

1. Create a `tailwind.config.js` file in your project root if you haven't already.
2. Add the following content to your `tailwind.config.js`:

```
module.exports = {
  darkMode: ["class"],
  content: [
    './pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    './app/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    './src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [require("tailwindcss-animate")],
}
```

Create a globals.css file in your styles directory and add the following:

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Import the `globals.css` file in your main application file (e.g., `_app.tsx` for Next.js).

#### 3. Importing and using your first Shadcn component

Now that Shadcn is installed and configured, let's import and use your first component. We'll use the Button component as an example:

Import the Button component in your desired file:

```
import { Button } from "@shadcn/ui/button"
```

Use the Button component in your JSX:

```
<Button variant="outline">Click me</Button>
```

Here's a comparison of some common Button variants you can use:

| Variant | Description                   | Use Case              |
| :------ | :---------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| default | Standard button               | General purpose       |
| outline | Button with outline           | Secondary actions     |
| ghost   | Transparent button            | Subtle actions        |
| link    | Button that looks like a link | Navigation within tex |

By following these steps, you've successfully installed Shadcn, configured it in your project, and used your first component. This sets the foundation for exploring more of Shadcn's core components and building more complex UI elements in your project.

Next, we'll delve deeper into Shadcn's core components, examining their features and how to customize them to fit your specific needs.
